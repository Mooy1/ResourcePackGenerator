# Slimefun Texture Generator

This generator will create a texture pack and generate properties files for item textures.

It is for Optifine only!

# How to use

1. Create a folder for the generator to work in.

2. Run the generator to create a pack.properties file.

3. Close it and open the properties file.

4. Set your pack name and description.

5. Add a pack.png image for your pack into the folder.

6. Create a folder called 'textures'. You can put any non-item textures in here like armor. (They can be organized into sub folders if you want)

7. Create a folder within the 'textures' folder called 'items'. This is where all of your item textures should be. (They can be organized into sub folders if you want)

9. Add each item texture image to the 'items' folder with the name 'slimefun_id.minecraft_id.png'. For example: 'reinforced_alloy_ingot.iron_ingot.png'.

8. Run the generator again to generate your pack.

10. If you add more textures, just run it again to generate a new pack.
